# configuration_apple_os

note: I'm opting to go for nix + home-manager and will modify this repo, over time, to reflect this; it will work for most linux and mac machines I use.

## what

[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) scripting to get an Apple machine set up for basic development

## why

I need something that works for an individual user on an arbitrary Apple machine; basic `Zsh` scripting provides this on even under very stringent security set ups; I would prefer to use `Nix` like I do on [EC2 instances](https://github.com/ojhermann/nix-os-ec2)

## how

I've created some `Zsh` scripts to install an configure a few applications, scripts, and related matters; to use this repo, copy it to the `Documents` folder on your Apple machine and then execute `main.sh`
